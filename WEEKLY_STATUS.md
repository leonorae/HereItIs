The database design (SQL_TESTING.md) was submitted.
Actual implementation of the database is well underway and an API has been developed, with appropriate code for acessing the database placed into each Flask route.
Frontend work on the Jinja templates is also well underway.
Focus this week will be on reviewing and finalizing the overall file structure for the project in order to merge the frontend and backend branches as well as implementing their integration into a functional application.

## Status of Web Pages
- See PAGE_TESTING.md document for completed specification of web page design with images.
- First draft of home page was completed, complete with CSS stylesheet and possible javascript implementation of loading from list of events.

## Status of Database
- Matt created new APIs to retrieve specific data
- William reported a bug that Mohammed will meet after the meeting to discuss
- Overall, the frontend communication is working good with backend
- Mohammed and Matt met, Python code, API, and actual first version of database (using Render), has been implemented.
