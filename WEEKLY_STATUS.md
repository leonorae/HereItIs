The focus of this week was the completion of the Web Page design for milestone #4 which has almost been completed. The specifications of each page has been completed and agreed upon by the team, and the descriptions of the tests will be completed and the mockup images finalized to complete the milestone, after which the focus will move to implementation of the Flask backend, HTML/CSS code itself, and Database design.
