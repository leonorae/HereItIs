## Vision statement:
HereItIs is the goto place _online_ to connect with your local music scene _offline_. We are a centralized location for music event announcement, management, and engagement, bringing together fans, artists, event planners, and more.

#### Potential benefits for all users:
- Keep tabs on other artists, promoters, venues, and superfans by following what they're up to.

#### Potential benefits for fans:
- You've got taste! Filter search results to find exactly what you're looking for. It could be an artist's genre or a venue's vibe, subscribe to what you're interested in so you're always in the loop.
- Show your support! Show other fans which events you'll be attending and see what your friends are up to.
- Soundcheck! Preview artists before you step out the door so you get an idea of what to expect.

#### Potential benefits for artists:
- Promote! Let fans see what events you have coming up next so they never miss a performance. Let them know where they can follow you on social media!
- Get support from your fans! Display your preferred methods for receiving tips and selling merch.
- Get discovered! Find new fans looking for artists in your genre.

#### Potential benefits for event planners:
- Pump Up the Jam! Build hype for upcoming concerts, shows, and more.

## Motivation:
Many of us are involved in local music scenes, which often have events organized on various social media websites. These are spread out across platforms and disorganized, relying on communication between individuals. Present solutions like Resident Advisor or Dice only capture a small slice of local scenes, and in the case of Resident Advisor, do not allow users to filter by music genre. Furthermore, Resident Advisor offers limited features to assist in organizing and managing events. We want to fill-in the gaps where we can to help our local scenes grow! 

## Risks to project completion:
- Unfamiliar with webapp development, little HTML/CSS/Javascript experience among the team
- No prior experience with team members
- Time constraint to implement all features and potential for scope creep
- Challenging availability schedule and timezone across different team members.

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
- Devoting time to learning, focusing on functionality above aesthetic design.
- Assessing team member strengths and organizing work accordingly, aided by adherence to Agile methodologies. Using weekly meetings to adjust strategy and flexible/dynamic organization of work apart from weekly meetings in Discord chat.
- Limiting scope of app to music events (rather than events in general), contained to a local scene within a single city/region. Focus early on identifying key/necessary features.
- Continous open communication between team members and support to each other.

# Development method:
- Weekly Scrum meetings and assigning scrum master
- User Stories
- kanban via [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/66ee14f2ebb2bed462a868ac/ATTI55abcb1be45640ce0b7573874bbff32f36463F4F/wizardteam)
- Ad-hoc tasks discussed via Discord
