## Vision statement EXPAND:
HereItIs is the goto place _online_ to connect with your local music scene _offline_. We are a centralized location for music event announcement, management, and engagement, bringing together fans, artists, event planners, and more.

Potential benefits for all users:
- Keep tabs on other artists, promoters, venues, and superfans by following what they're up to.

Potential benefits for fans:
- You've got taste! Filter search results to find exactly what you're looking for. It could be an artist's genre or a venue's vibe.
- Soundcheck! Preview artists before you step out the door so you get

Potential benefits for artists:
- Encore! See moments captured by your fans at the show to engage with your loyal fans and grow your audience.

Potential benefits for event planners:
- Pump Up the Jam! Build hype for upcoming concerts, shows, and more.

## Motivation EXPAND:
Many of us are involved in local music scenes, which often have events organized on various social media websites.
These are often spread out across platforms and disorganized, relying on communication between individuals.  

## Risks to project completion:
- Unfamiliar with webapp development, little HTML/CSS/Javascript experience among the team
- No prior experience with team members
- Time constraint to implement all features and potential for scope creep

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
- Devoting time to learning, focusing on functionality above aesthetic design.
- Assessing team member strengths and organizing work accordingly, aided by adherence to Agile methodologies. Using weekly meetings to adjust strategy and flexible/dynamic organization of work apart from weekly meetings in Discord chat.
- Limiting scope of app to music events (rather than events in general), contained to a local scene within a single city/region. Focus early on identifying key/necessary features.

# Development method EXPAND:
- Weekly Scrum meetings
- User Stories
- kanban via Trello
