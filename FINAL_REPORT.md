## Final Status Report and Reflection

### What We Completed
- PostgreSQL database with API to access the data.
- The backend framework in Flask is deployed in Render.
- HTML and JavaScript front-end layout and functionality that meets the project's objective.
- Functional demo of the website addressing the goals of the project.

### What We Were in the Middle of Implementing
- List a venue page from the website. Currently, you can only list artists and events.
- Incorporate more filtering parameters for event and artist selection.

### What We Had Planned for the Future
- Use AI to auto-gather details from artists' and venues' social media pages.
- Security features such as personal accounts with admin privileges to some users.
- Fans can follow each other and see what their friends are attending.
- Artists/venues can sell tickets on our website.
- Embed music in Artist pages.

### Known Problems (Bugs, Issues)
- Users can insert images with links that are not working. 
- Events must use ArtistID and EventID to be added (ideally use Artist Username and Venue Name).
- The get-listed page sidebar doesn't change the artist's color or an event when selected.
